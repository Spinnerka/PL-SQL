This was my final project for my Advanced Database classs from California State University Long Beach.

This program is set up to allow a student to enroll in a class.

It goes through and checks to make sure the student meets the parameters to enroll.

It also checks to make sure the class has seats available. If not, the student gets put on the waitlist.

If a student drops a class the program will find the next student and enroll them in the class after preforming the checks again
